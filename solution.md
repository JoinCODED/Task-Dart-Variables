1. Start by defining your main function:

```dart
void main() {
}
```

2. Let's define our first variable which is `firstName` of type `String`.

```dart
void main() {
    String firstName = "John";
}
```

3. `lastName` is a `String` as well:

```dart
void main() {
    String firstName = "John";
    String lastName = "Doe";
}
```

4. `age` is a number, so we have to define it with `int`:

```dart
void main() {
    String firstName = "John";
    String lastName = "Doe";
    int age = 24;
}
```

5. And lastly, `height` is a number as well but with decimal places so we will define it with `double`:

```dart
void main() {
    String firstName = "John";
    String lastName = "Doe";
    int age = 24;
    double height = 1.78;
}
```

6. Now use `print` to print your variables one by one to the console:

```dart
void main() {
    String firstName = "John";
    String lastName = "Doe";
    int age = 24;
    double height = 1.78;

    print(firstName);
    print(lastName);
    print(age);
    print(height);
}
```

### üçã booleans

1. Create a variable called `married` of type boolean:

```dart
void main() {
    String firstName = "John";
    String lastName = "Doe";
    int age = 24;
    double height = 1.78;
    bool married = false;
    print(firstName);
    print(lastName);
    print(age);
    print(height);
}
```

2. Print it to the console:

```dart
void main() {
    String firstName = "John";
    String lastName = "Doe";
    int age = 24;
    double height = 1.78;
    bool married = false;
    print(firstName);
    print(lastName);
    print(age);
    print(height);
    print(married);
}
```
