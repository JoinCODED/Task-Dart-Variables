# Variables 🧶

Create some variables to define your `firstName`, `lastName`, `age`, `height`.

Then, print these variables.

Example for John, Doe, 24, 1.78, the console log should read:

```
John
Doe
24
1.78
```

### 🍋 booleans

Create another variable called `married` which it's value is either `true` or `false`.

# String Interpolation ➕

Given the following variables:

```dart
double temperature = 20;
String drink = 'juice';
String flavor = 'orange';
```

Use `print` and string interpolation to achieve this output in the console:

```
The temperature is 20C
I like orange juice.
```

The output should update correctly if we change the values of the variables.

For example, if temperature is 30, the output should print:

```
The temperature is 30C
```

### 🍋 Arithmetic spice

Create a new variable called `number` of type `int`:

```dart
int number = 5;
```

And achieve this output in the console:

```
5 plus 5 makes 10
```

# String Methods 🔧

Given 1 variable

```dart
String fullName = " John doe";
```

Using string methods achieve this output:

```
My name is  JOHN and my last name length is 3
```

### 🍋 White Spaces

Open those [docs](https://api.dart.dev/stable/2.16.1/dart-core/String-class.html) and look for a string method that will get rid of the white spaces for us to achieve this output:

```
My name is JOHN and my last name length is 3
```

### 🌶 Does My Last Name Starts With The Letter d?

Using the same docs, look for a method that checks if the last name: `doe` starts with the letter `d`.

Output:

```
true
```
